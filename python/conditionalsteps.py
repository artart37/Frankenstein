x = 5
if x < 10:
    print ("Smaller")
# Please note that : means "then", and we need to indent the code after "if" to make the code run. So the code of the "if" function need to be at another level.
#In other words, we need have a space before the code of the "if" statement
if x > 10:
    print("Bigger")
#The output will be Smaller, and "Finish" afterwards, because 5 is assigned to x, which is less than 10, therefore the second if will be skipped and th elast print will be executed
print("Finish")
